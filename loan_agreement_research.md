| Annual Percentage Rate | Finance Charge | Amount Financed | Total Payments | Total Sales Price |
|------------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| (yearly cost %)        | (total cost $) | (loan amount $) | (total paid $) | (if applicable)   |

Additional required disclosures:

### Key TILA Requirements:
1. Disclosures must be provided BEFORE the borrower agrees to the loan
2. Borrower must be allowed to leave with written disclosures to comparison shop
3. APR is the yearly interest rate - lower APR = better deal
4. Payment Schedule shows how much money and for how long
